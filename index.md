## Course Description

This course covers programming and other computer skills required
  for the research and application of statistical methods. The focus
  will be on programming in the R language; we will cover the basic
  language elements and methods for software development in R. We will
  also cover computing topics such as coding best practices, version
  control, copyright law, and graphics.

## Textbooks

The following books will be used in the course and are available free
from Leanpub.com:

* [R Programming for Data Science](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming),
  by Roger D. Peng (you can also read this book [on the web](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/))

* [Exploratory Data Analysis with R](https://leanpub.com/exdata), by
  Roger D. Peng

* [Report Writing for Data Science in
  R](https://leanpub.com/reportwriting), by Roger D. Peng

The following books may also be useful and are available in web format only:

* [R Programming for Research](https://geanders.github.io/RProgrammingForResearch/), by Brooke Anderson and Rachel Severson

* [Mastering Software Development in
  R](http://rdpeng.github.io/RProgDA), by Roger D. Peng, Sean Kross,
  and Brooke Anderson

## Software

We will make heavy use of R in this course, so you should have R installed. You can obtain R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.rstudio.com). There are versions available for Mac, Windows, and Unix/Linux. This software is **required** for this course.	

I will also make use of the RStudio interactive development environment (IDE). RStudio requires that R be installed, and so is a kind of "add-on" to R. I **strongly** recommend that you install this software. You can obtain the RStudio Desktop from the [RStudio web site](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/).

## Homework

There will be 3 assignments, due roughly every 3 weeks. Homeworks will be
submitted electronically via the Dropbox on the CoursePlus web site.

The homework assignments will be due on 

* Homework 1: September 16, 11:59pm
* Homework 2: October 7, 11:59pm
* Homework 3: October 26, 11:59pm

### Homework collaboration

Please feel free to study together and talk to one another about
homework assignments. The mutual instruction that students give each
other is among the most valuable that can be achieved. However, it is
expected that homework assignments will be implemented and written up
independently unless otherwise specified. Specifically, please do not
share analytic code or output. Please do not collaborate on write-up
and interpretation. Please do not access or use solutions from any
source before your homework assignment is submitted for grading.

## Exams

There are no exams in this course.

## Academic Ethics and Student Conduct Code

Students enrolled in the Bloomberg School of Public Health of The Johns Hopkins University assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner appropriate to the University's mission as an institution of higher education. A student is obligated to refrain from acts which he or she knows, or under the circumstances has reason to know, impair the academic integrity of the University. Violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to: cheating; plagiarism; knowingly furnishing false information to any agent of the University for inclusion in the academic record; violation of the rights and welfare of animal or human subjects in research; and misconduct as a member of either School or University committees or recognized groups or organizations.

Students should be familiar with the policies and procedures specified under Policy and Procedure Manual Student-01 (Academic Ethics), available on the school’s [portal](http://my.jhsph.edu).

The faculty, staff and students of the Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins University have the shared responsibility to conduct themselves in a manner that upholds the law and respects the rights of others. Students enrolled in the School are subject to the Student Conduct Code (detailed in Policy and Procedure Manual Student-06) and assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner which upholds the law and respects the rights of others. They are responsible for maintaining the academic integrity of the institution and for preserving an environment conducive to the safe pursuit of the School's educational, research, and professional practice missions.

## Disability Support Services
