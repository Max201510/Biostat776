## Homework 1: Tidy Data

### DUE: 9/16

The goal of the first assignment is to take datasets that are either messy or simply not tidy and to make them tidy datasets. The objective is to gain some familiarity with the functions in the `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `readr` packages.

Before attempting this assignment, you should first install the `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages if you haven't already. This can be done with the `install.packages()` function.


```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "readr"))
```

Running this function will also install a host of other packages on which these two depend so it make take a minute or two.

### Homework Submission

Please write up your homework using R markdown and knitr. Compile your document as an HTML file submit your HTML file to the dropbox on Courseplus. Please **show all your code** for each of the answers to the three parts.

### Reading

For this homework, the following readings may be helpful:

* [Chapter 7 of R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/using-the-readr-package.html)

* [Chapter 13 of RPDS](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/managing-data-frames-with-the-dplyr-package.html)

* [Sections 1.2 through 1.5 of Mastering Software Development in R](http://rdpeng.github.io/RProgDA/the-importance-of-tidy-data.html)


### Part 1

Load the `WorldPhones` dataset in the `datasets` package with


```r

This dataset gives the number of telephones in various regions of the world (in thousands). The regions are: North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Oceania, Africa, Central America and data are available for the years 1951, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961.

Use the functions in `dplyr` and `tidyr` to produce a data frame that looks like this.

You may need to use functions outside these packages to obtain this result.

### Part 2

Use the `readr` package to read the [SPEC_2014.csv.bz2](../data/SPEC_2014.csv.bz2) data file in to R. This file contains daily levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) chemical constituents across the United States. The data are measured at a network of federal, state, and local monitors and assembled by the EPA. 

In this dataset, the `Sample.Value` column provides the level of the indicated chemical constituent and the `Parameter.Name` column provides the name of the chemical constituent. The combination of a `State.Code`, a `County.Code`, and a `Site.Num`, uniquely identifies a monitoring site (the location of which is provided by the `Latitude` and `Longitude` columns).

For all of the questions below, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset, so when taking averages, just remove the missing values before taking the average.

Use the functions in the `dplyr` package to answer the following questions:

1. What is average value of "Bromine PM2.5 LC" in the state of Wisconsin in this dataset?

2. Calculate the average of each chemical constituent across all states/monitors and all time points. Which constituent has the highest average level?

3. Which monitoring site has the highest levels of "Sulfate PM2.5 LC"? Indicate the state code, county code, and site number.

4. What is the difference in the average levels of "EC PM2.5 LC TOR" between California and New York?

5. What are the median levels of "OC PM2.5 LC TOR" and "EC PM2.5 LC TOR" in the western and eastern U.S.? Define western as any monitoring location that has a `Longitude` less than -100.


### Part 3

Use the `readxl` package to read the file [aqs_sites.xlsx](../data/aqs_sites.xlsx) into R (you may need to install the package first). This file contains metadata about each of the monitoring sites in the EPA's monitoring system. In particular, the `Land Use` and `Location Setting` variables contain information about what kinds of areas the monitors are located in (i.e. "residential" vs. "forest").

Use the functions in the `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages to answer the following questions.

1. How many monitoring sites are labelled as both "RESIDENTIAL" for `Land Use` and "SUBURBAN" for `Location Setting`?

1. What are the median levels of "OC PM2.5 LC TOR" and "EC PM2.5 LC TOR" amongst monitoring sites that are labelled as both "RESIDENTIAL" and "SUBURBAN" in the eastern U.S., where eastern is defined as `Longitude` greater than or equal to -100?
